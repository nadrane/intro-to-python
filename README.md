## Projects

http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/ contains a number of projects that will be great for beginners. The 3rd project on the list (the madlibs one) looks very doable. It reviews almost exclusively concepts that were covered in class but is far simpler than our calculator. If you found the class overwhelming, this is a good place to start.

If that project seems to easy, take a look at projects 1 and 2. And if those are too easy, projects 4 and 5 start ramping up in difficulty.
